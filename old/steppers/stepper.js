function setActiveStep(stepNumber) {
    // Select all step containers (divs with the number inside)
    // This is a simple demo logic. In a real app, this would be handled by state management.

    // For demonstration purposes, let's toggle the styles logic visually
    // Note: In a real-world scenario, you'd probably use classes like 'step--active' vs 'step--inactive'

    // Reset all to inactive look first (just conceptual, since we hardcoded styles in HTML for the demo)
    console.log(`Step ${stepNumber} clicked. Logic to update state would go here.`);
